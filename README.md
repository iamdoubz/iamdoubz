# ðŸ‘„ Quotes

- The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.
- I see myself as an intelligent, sensitive human, with the soul of a clown which forces me to blow it at the most important moments.
- Some people can read War and Peace and come away thinking it's a simple adventure story. Others can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and unlock the secrets of the universe.
